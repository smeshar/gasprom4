# Descrpition
It is console Win64 (I didn't test it on Win32) game, where you can trade virtual crypto vault. The goal it's to be the richest in the game.

# How to install
- Download **exe.win-amd64-3.9.rar** from the latest realese
- Unarchive **exe.win-amd64-3.9.rar** to the folder in your pc
- Install [RadminVPN](https://download.radmin-vpn.com/download/files/Radmin_VPN_1.4.4642.1.exe).
- Launch **main.exe**

# Why RadminVPN?
Gasprom Game uses **MySQL**, that is launched on my PC, because I don't have enough money to buy SQL server. I recommend you to use RadminVPN, because it makes all people connected in LAN network, so game can connect to my **MySQL server**.

# Ideas
- Create sports betting game called "**MuhamBET**"
- Create Android version of Gasprom Game
